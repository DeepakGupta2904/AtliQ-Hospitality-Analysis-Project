# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis-Project

Domain:- Travel and Tourism

Tools & Technologies:- Python(Jupiter Notebook), Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Power point

Overview:- The AtliQ Hospitality Analysis project focuses on providing insights for AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain in India that is facing declining market share and revenue due to strategic missteps and ineffective decision-making. The project leverages data science to address these challenges and is categorized under the travel and tourism domain, with an advanced difficulty level.

Key Features:-
1. Filters: Properties, city, status, platform, month, and week
2. Key Metrics: Revenue, Occupancy Percentage, and Average Rating
3. Breakdown by City and Property: Includes trends by week, occupancy by day type, and booking percentage by platform

Problem Statement:-

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue.

However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

The tasks to be done in the project:-

1. Data Collection:- Gather historical data on AtliQ Grands' properties, including revenue, occupancy, customer ratings, and booking platforms.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:- Preprocess the data for analysis by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues.
3. Data Analysis:-
A. Analyze revenue, occupancy percentage, and average customer ratings.

B. Explore trends by city, property, week, and day type.

C. Investigate booking percentages by platform.

4. Visualizations:-

A. Create dashboards in Tableau or Power BI to visualize key metrics like revenue trends, occupancy rates, and customer ratings.

B. Implement filters for properties, cities, status, platform, month, and week.

Conclusion of the project:-

By leveraging data-driven insights, AtliQ Grands can make informed strategic decisions to address the challenges of declining market share and revenue. The analysis of key metrics such as revenue, occupancy rates, customer ratings, and booking platforms provides a comprehensive understanding of performance across different cities and properties. With the use of visualizations in Tableau or Power BI, management can easily identify trends, optimize operations, and implement targeted strategies to improve business outcomes. This data intelligence approach will help AtliQ Grands regain its competitive edge in the luxury hotel market.
